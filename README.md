**How It's Made:**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, template provided by html5up.com

The basis of the website is created from a template skeleton. My reasoning for this being that the clients needs were simple and straightforward so to make best use of my time and their money, used a UI template and focus on the clients core need - delivering information and creating an online presence. After the template was spun up, I wrote a script of JavaScript for the number counters in that attributes section. This is done using Intersection Observer with each element being watched individually in order to create the difference in count speed between the two. 

**Lessons Learned:**
The importance of delivering on a clients needs using the *right* tools. In Web Development there can definitely be a feeling of (at least for myself) needing to reinvent the wheel when in actuality, not every client wants that. This was my first client whom had gotten by so long without a web presence and needed just (and only) that - a presence. Some clients need multipage apps with the works and others just want their name out there more. It's important as a Web Developer to discern which client you're dealing with and when to not only optimize my process, but to pass cost savings to the client.
